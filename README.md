# Simple Voting System 

This project implements a basic, front-end voting system where users can cast votes for a list of candidates, and the vote counts are displayed and persisted locally in the browser's local storage.

## Features

Candidate Display:Presents a list of predefined candidates to the user.
Vote Casting: Allows users to cast a vote for their chosen candidate by clicking a "Vote" button.
Real-time Vote Updates: Immediately updates the vote count displayed on the page after a vote is cast.
Local Vote Persistence: Vote counts are stored in the browser's localStorage.
Vote Count Display:Shows the current number of votes for each candidate, sorted by the number of votes received.

## Technologies Used

HTML:Provides the structural foundation of the voting interface, including the candidate list, vote buttons, and results display.
CSS:Styles the HTML elements to create a user-friendly and visually appealing layout.
JavaScript: Handles the dynamic behavior of the voting system, including:
    * Dynamically rendering the list of candidates.
    * Handling click events on the "Vote" buttons.
    * Updating the vote counts in the browser's localStorage.
    * Displaying the current vote counts on the page.
